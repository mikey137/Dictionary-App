# Dictionary App

This project was built with React. It is a dictionary app that uses the Merriam-Webster API to retrieve definitions and the Unsplash API to retrieve images. My motivation for developing this app was to gain experience obtaining data from third-party APIs. In addition, I wanted to improve my understanding of UX/UI principles.
